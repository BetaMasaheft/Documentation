               <h3>History</h3>
               <p>
                  <div class="container-fluid">The town of Gondar is located in today's <a href="../../Places/LOC6544NorthGondar">North Gondar</a> Zone (historically
                     <a href="../../Places/LOC1713Bagemd">Bagemdǝr</a> province) in the
                     <a href="../../Places/LOC1426Amhara">ʾAmhārā</a> Regional State. Gondar
                     started to flourish after 
                     <roleName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="title" full="yes">ʾaṣe</roleName>
                     <a href="../../Persons/PRS4015Fasilada">Fāsiladas</a> chose it as his camp in
                     1636-'37 to control the collection of customs on the <a href="../../Places/LOC5339RedSea">Red Sea</a> - <a href="../../Places/LOC5888Tana">
                        Ṭānā</a> - <a href="../../Places/LOC2966Ennary">ʾƎnnāryā</a> trade
                     routes. Following its foundation and for approx. 130 years (from
                     1630s to 1760s), Gondar was the political,
                     religious, cultural and intellectual capital of the <a href="../../Places/LOC6554GondarineK">Gondarine Kingdom</a>. Its founder <a href="../../Persons/PRS4015Fasilada">Fāsiladas</a> built the first nucleus of the
                     town including his castle, some churches and his pleasure pool. After him, his
                     son 
                     <roleName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="title" full="yes">ʾaṣe</roleName>
                     <a href="../../Persons/PRS10375Yohanne">Yoḥānnǝs I</a> and grandson 
                     <roleName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="title" full="yes">ʾaṣe</roleName>
                     <a href="../../Persons/PRS5616IyasuI">Iyāsu I</a> chose to remain in Gondar and
                     built their own castles and churches. So by the late 17th century,
                     Gondar had become a permanent and sizeable settlement where Ethiopian rulers
                     resided when not campaigning and where the highest commerical, political and
                     religious classes gathered around the throne. In the 17th century
                     Gondar also became the major commercial centre of northern <a href="../../Places/LOC3010Ethiop">Ethiopia</a>. During the 18th
                     century, the royal compound was completed with the construction of
                     castles by <a href="../../Persons/PRS3430DawitII">Dāwit III</a>, <a href="../../Persons/PRS2377Bakaffa">Bakāffā</a> and <a href="../../Persons/PRS5617IyasuII">Iyāsu II</a>, the church of <a href="../../Places/LOC1582ASSaSa">ʾAṭṭāṭāmi
                        Mikāʾel</a> by <a href="../../Persons/PRS3430DawitII">Dāwit III</a>
                     and various subsidiary buildings (the whole surrounded by a double wall with
                     twelve gates and reinforcing towers). However, by the late 18th
                     century, no more castles were built and, from the 19th
                     century, Gondar gradually lost its political power and shrank in size
                     while the centre of the power moved to <a href="../../Places/LOC5597Sawa">Šawā</a>. <a href="../../Persons/PRS9430Tewodros">Tewodros II</a>
                     set his capital in <a href="../../Places/LOC2385DabraT">Dabra Tābor</a> and,
                     in 1866 attacked, burnt and looted Gondar. Finally, in
                     1888 and 1889, the Mahdists attacked and burnt
                     down what was left of the city which saw some redevelopment only in the
                     1920s . During the Italian occupation, Gondar became the
                     capital of the <a href="../../Places/LOC6552Amhara">Provincia di Amhara</a>
                     (one of six provinces forming the <a href="../../Places/LOC6553Africa">Africa
                        Orientale Italiana</a>), it was restructured and rebuilt along
                     modernist lines and its population increased significantly. After the defeat of
                     the Italians in 1941, Gondar became the capital of the Province of
                     <a href="../../Places/LOC1713Bagemd">Bagemdǝr</a> and <a href="../../Places/LOC5671Semen">Sǝmen</a>, flourished and grew in population
                     becoming a major commercial and cultural centre.

                     lived in clearly separated quarters and neighbourhoods: the royal court and
                     nobility on the one hand; the merchants, craftsmen and commoners on the other.
