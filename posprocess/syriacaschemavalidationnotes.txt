aim 1 : produce document in good non abbreviated TEI
aim2: check for possible improvments to data entry schema

select from list changes for both, produce schema to validate output (enrich-betamesaheft)

* no @type in TEI
* pubPlace before authority in publicationStmt
* p in licence
* corresp in repository, title > ref with url
temporary base url https://www.betamasaheft.uni-hamburg.de/
* in title type= Complete not accepted. Uniform or Supplied. check values.
* use always @ref instead of @corresp
* in element ref use target with full url
* @evidence not supported in title
* no intext biblStruct (from Zotero) only plain bibl
* <material>parchment</material> not @key also in element binding
* no objectType but  @form="codex" in objectDesc. takes also scroll, leaf or other
* extent dimensions without type
* measure with @unit into height, width, depth
* unit allowed NOT mm but CM
* no @type="blank"
* leaves into a measure @type=‘composition’. ONLY 1
* no support for measure unit quire.
* no support for measure/ dim in items of collation. collation is given as a string in a paragraph
* <condition key="good"/> —> 
                        <condition>good</condition>
* script Ethiopic not allowed, and use of language abbreviation in script. I think this is not correct, as assumes identity of language and script, and is project specific in the schema (plenty of syriac scripts, nothing else).
* ab[@type=script] —> seg[@type=script]
* ab[@type=rubrication] —> seg[@type=rubrication]
* instead of type in desc, syriaca uses a project specifica attribute syriaca-tag in item, not in desc.
* custEvent in element, not in type
* particDesc not used by syriaca
* element keyword require @scheme
* no corresp in langUsage
* decoNOte not supported into binding
* listBibl needs bibl, not biblStruct from Zotero
* no relations supported??
