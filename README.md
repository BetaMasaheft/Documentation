This repo is for workflow and development subprojects. None of this is guaranteed or released, but feel free to reuse it if you find anything interesting to you.

The posprocess transformation takes data entered which validates to an editing schema and populates all relevant elements.

The preview transformation, meant only for testing and internal review uses school-basic html and:
- some bootstrap for layout
- Leaflet and Mapbox for maps
- VisColl https://github.com/leoba/VisColl for the collation visualization

The catalogueMyCore contains a transformation to convert data from a previous project.

the Biblio folder is a transformation of data in bespoke TEI into Zotero RDF for initial import.
