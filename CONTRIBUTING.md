# Creating good issues 

Please use one of the templates. Try to be clear 
and detail the problem you are seeing in a way that those who can help to solve it do not 
have to spend hours figuring out what you meant. 

# Creating meaningful Pull requests
One PR for one file with one new line is not reasonable.
One PR for 2000 files with a comma changed in each is not reasonable.
Please try to put yourself in the place of your reviewer, make the contents of your PR consistent and describe them in a way that allows others to review
in a reasonable way your contribution

Seeing the file online is no good excuse for bad Pull Requests habits.

# Links to external documentation
Please, always refer to the Guidelines https://betamasaheft.eu/Guidelines/ and add links to them.
If your commit is related to an Issue or Pull Request, please add a link in the Comments to the Commit.

a clear way, so that others can take their time to fullfill your wishes as an act of kindness.
