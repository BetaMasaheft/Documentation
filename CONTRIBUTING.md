# Introduction

Thank you for participating in the constant conversation that makes the Beta maṣāḥəft digital research environment possible!

Whether you are interacting with others by creating and reacting to issues, by making and reviewing Pull Requests or in other ways, please take a few instants to read the following remarks to make all interactions as agreeable and efficient as possible. 

# Communicating in the BetaMasaheft GitHub organization
In all your online communications, please be as clear and concise as possible, while giving all information you feel is relevant. 

Please adhere to common rules of orthography and punctuation, which make the reading experience more agreeable.

In order to prevent common misunderstandings, please refrain from the use of irony and rhetorical questions.

One of the strengths of this digital research environment is the diversity of those working with it. Contributors come from various backgrounds and are not all familiar with the same topics. Please remember this, when terminology obvious to you - be it informatical, codicological or philological - is not understood by all. 

Remember that the persons interacting here are all, as you, real people and wish to be treated as such. While conciseness is important for all, so is a basic standard of common politeness.

When in doubt about which kinds of behaviour (in editing, answering, commenting, reviewing...) are appropriate, just ask!  

# Creating good issues 

Please use one of the templates. Try to be as clear as possible
and detail the problem you are seeing in a way facilitating the work of those who can help to solve it. 

# Creating meaningful Pull requests
The number of sensible changes and files changed per Pull Request can be varied, but should be within reasonable limits, considering the work of the reviewers.
Usually, one Pull Request for one file with one new line is not reasonable, and neither is one Pull Request for 2000 files with a comma changed in each.
Please try to put yourself in the place of your reviewer, make the contents of your Pull Request consistent and describe them in a way that allows others to review your contribution in a reasonable way. In cases of doubt, do ask your reviewers which kinds of Pull Requests they prefer. 
Please consider that thouroughly reviewing Pull Requests requires a considerable investment of time and concentration from the reviewers, who cannot always interrupt their other commitments to make each Pull Request a priority.

Seeing the file quickly online is no good excuse for bad Pull Requests habits. 


# Links to external documentation
Please, always refer to the Guidelines https://betamasaheft.eu/Guidelines/ and add links to them.

# Community and behavioral expectations
All data in the Beta Masaheft Organization is collaboratively edited. We expect that you do your best and that if you see place for 
improvement, you try to fix it yourself first, if possible. All you do will be aknowledged in all the ways we can. If you do not feel
good enough in the encoding to try yourself, you can ask and get support. If you just do not want to try yourself, express your suggestions 
a clear way, so that others can take their time to fulfill your wishes as an act of kindness.
